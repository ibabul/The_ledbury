# The Ledbury

I copied the website of The Ledbury for practice. Here I have demonstrated a couple of features

* CSS Positioning.
* CSS display property.
* CSS-based dropdown.
* Use of relative and absolute positioning.
* Navigation menu using unordered list
* Linking google fonts.
* CSS normalization.
